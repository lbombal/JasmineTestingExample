THE JASMINE TESTS IN THIS EXAMPLE DO NOT WORK PROPERLY.  In particular,
the mocks (spyOn) for ajax calls do not work as expected.  This may be an
issue with newer versions of Jasmine (2.0).

The Jasmine spec contains several changes from the one in the text
due to changes in Jasmine syntax and deprecation of old features.

If you are able to get this example working, please let me know.
One possible option is to use the jasmine-ajax gem to stub out ajax calls rather
than spyOn.  I haven't had a chance to try this but it looks like a
promising option.

Note:  This repo does not include the:
config/initializers/omniauth.rb
file that contains the client key and client secret for twitter and github.

Before running this example, you will need to authorize the app for twitter
and github sign-in and create the omniauth.rb file containing the keys and
secrets obtained during the authorization process.  See the lecture slides for
the format of this file.
